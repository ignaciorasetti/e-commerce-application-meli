## Introduction
This project had a propose to learn how the MercadoLibre API works and create a few applications based on it.

* Why is called "Challenge"? Because I wanted to challenge myself to create these applications from the ground up as soon as possible, measure my development skills.

## Project
This project is divided into various applications.

### Proxy API
To obtain data from the MercadoLibre API and create custom responses.
* [meli-challenge-proxyapi-golang](./meli-challenge-proxyapi-golang/)
* [meli-challenge-proxyapi-nodejs](./meli-challenge-proxyapi-nodejs/)

These two apps behive the same. The only difference is which language were built in.

### Web
* [meli-challenge-web](./meli-challenge-web/): A Web React application to show data from the API.
